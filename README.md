## Tests / Future Developments. 
​
> Test Development strategy is in progress. 

> This project could be used for small clinic with 3 to 4 doctors. In the future, if the clinic manager want to expand to other locations, we could: 

Add 'Location' at the homepage, before patients can choose doctor. 

Doctor login page, doctors could see their coming up appointments and with whom. 

Appointment confirmation comes from doctor.
